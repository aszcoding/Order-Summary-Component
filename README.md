## My process
I started with the mobile design first, added the active states, and coded the media queries last.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- Box Glow

### What I learned

I became more familiar with box glow/box shadow through this project.

### Continued development

I'm going to look more into box glow and box shadow properties to become more familiar with them for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CodersBlock](https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/) - This helped me understand how to create a slight glowing effect along the bottom of the "Proceed" button.
